it all put into words, or did both understand that they had the same thing at heart and in their minds, so that there was no need to speak of it aloud, and better not to speak of it. Most likely it was partly like that, from mother's letter it's evident: he struck her as rude a little, and mother in her simplicity took her observations to Dounia. And she was sure to be vexed and â€˜answered her angrily.' I should think so! Who would not be angered when it was quite clear without any naive questions and when it was under- stood that it was useless to discuss it. And why does she write to me, â€˜love Dounia, Rodya, and she loves you more than herself'? Has she a secret conscience-prick at sacri- ficing her daughter to her son? â€˜You are our one comfort, you are everything to us.' Oh, mother!"
