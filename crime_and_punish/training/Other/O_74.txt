"Avdotya Romanovna," Luzhin declared huffily, "your words are of too much consequence to me; I will say more, they are offensive in view of the position I have the honour to occupy in relation to you. To say nothing of your strange and offensive setting me on a level with an impertinent boy, you admit the possibility of breaking your promise to me. You say â€˜you or he,' showing thereby of how little conse- quence I am in your eyes... 1 cannot let this pass con- sidering the relationship and... the obligations existing between us."
