"Honoured sir,' he began almost with solemnity, "povert is not a vice, that's a true saying. Yet I know too Hat drunkenness is not a virtue, and that that's even truer. But beggary, honoured sir, beggary is a vice. In poverty you may still retain your innate nobility of soul, but in beggary- never-no one. For beggary a man is not chased out of hu- man society with a stick, he is swept out with a broom, so as to make it as humiliating as possible; and quite right too, forasmuch as in beggary I am ready to be the first to hu- miliate myself. Hence the pot house! Honoured sir, a month ago Mr. Lebeziatnikov gave my wife a beating, and my wife is a very different matter from me! Do you un- derstand? Allow me to ask you another question out of simple curiosity: have you ever spent a night on a hay barge, on the Neva?"
