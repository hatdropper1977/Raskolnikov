"May I venture, honoured sir, to engage you in polite con- versation? Forasmuch as, though your exterior would not command respect, my experience admonishes me that you are a man of education and not accustomed to drinking. I have always respected education when in conjunction with gen- uine sentiments, and I am besides a titular counsellor in rank. Marmeladov-such is my name; titular counsellor. I make bold to inquire-have you been in the service?"
