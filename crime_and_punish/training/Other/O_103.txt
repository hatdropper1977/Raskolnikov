"Yes, in our legal practice there was a case almost exactly similar, a case of morbid psychology,' Porfiry went on quickly. "A man confessed to murder and how he kept it up! It was a regular hallucination; he brought forward facts, he imposed upon every one and why? He had been partly, but only partly, unintentionally the cause of a murder and when he knew that he had given the murderers the opportunity, he sank into dejection, it got on his mind and turned his brain, he began imagining things and he persuaded himself that he was the murderer. But at last the High Court of Appeal went into it and the poor fellow was ac- quitted and put under proper care. Thanks to the Court of Appeal! Tut-tut-tut! Why, my dear fellow, you may drive yourself into delirium if you have the impulse to work upon > your nerves, to go ringing bells at night and asking about blood! I've studied all this morbid psychology in my practice. A man is sometimes tempted to jump out of win- dow or from a belfry. Just the same with bell-ringing. ... It's all illness, Rodion Romanovitch! You have begun to neglect your illness. You should consult an ex- perienced doctor, what's the good of that fat fellow? You are light-headed! You were delirious when you did all this !"
