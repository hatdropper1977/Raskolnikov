"Well," the orator began again stolidly and with even in- creased dignity, after waiting for the laughter in the room to subside. "Well, so be it, I am a pig, but she is a lady! I have the semblance of a beast, but Katerina Ivanovna, my spouse is a person of education and an officer's daughter Granted, granted, I am a scoundrel, but she is a woman of a noble heart, full of sentiments, refined by education. And yet... oh, if only she felt for me! Honoured sir, honoured sir, you know every man ought to have at least one place where people feel for him!! But Katerina Ivanovna, though she is magnanimous, she is unjust. ... And yet, al- though I realise that when she pulls my hair she only does it out of pity-for I repeat without being ashamed, she pulls my hair, young man," he declared with redoubled dignity, ' hearing the sniggering again-â€˜but, my God, if she would but once. ... But no, no! It's all in vain and it's no use talking! No use talking! For more than once, my wish did come true and more than once she has felt for me but... such is my fate and I am a beast by nature!"
