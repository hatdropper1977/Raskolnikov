"It's not Katerina Ivanovna I am afraid of now," he mut- tered in agitation-"and that she will begin pulling my hair. What does my hair matter! Bother my hair! That's what I say! Indeed it will be better if she does begin pulling it, that's not what Iam afraid of . . . it's her eyes I am afraid of . . . yes, her eyes . ... the red on her cheeks, too, frightens me . . . and her breathing too. . . . Have you noticed how people in that disease breathe . . . when they are excited? I am frightened of the children's crying, too. . . . For if Sonia has not taken them food. . . I don't know what's happened! I don't know! But blows I â€˜am not afraid of. . . . Know, sir, that such blows are not a pain to me, but even an enjoyment. In fact I can't get on without it. . . . It's better so. Let her strike me, it re- lieves her heart . . . it's better so... There is the house. The house of Kozel, the cabinet maker . . . a German, well-to-do. Lead the way!" |
