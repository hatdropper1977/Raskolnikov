would you do in hiding? It would be hateful and difficult for you, and what you need more than anything in life is a definite position, an atmosphere to suit you. And what sort of atmosphere would you have. If you ran away, you'd come back of yourself. You can't get on without us. And if I put you in prison,-say you've been there a month, or two, or three-remember my word, you'll confess of your- self and perhaps to your own surprise. You won't know an hour beforehand that you are coming with a confession. I am convinced that you will decide, â€˜to take your suffering.' You don't believe my words now, but you'll come to it of yourself. For suffering, Rodion Romanovitch, is a gre thing. Never mind my having grown fat, I know all the same. Don't laugh at it, there's an idea in suffering, Nikolay is right. No, you won't run away, Rodion Romanovitch."
